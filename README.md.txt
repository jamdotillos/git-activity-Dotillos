Git is a powerful version control system that helps track changes in code, making it easier to manage and collaborate on software projects. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories and allows developers to share their work, contribute to others' projects, and maintain a history of changes. I learned how basic Git commands like init, add, commit, push, pull, and clone are used to manage and sync code between local machines and GitHub. I also discovered that a repository is essentially a folder that stores all project files and their version history. Connecting Git to GitHub involves linking a local repository to a remote one using the git remote add command, followed by pushing changes online.
